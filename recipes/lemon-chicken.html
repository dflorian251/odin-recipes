        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A chicken breast cooked on grill marinaded with a combination of lemon juice and olive oil amongs others</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 large cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped red bell pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine lemon juice, olive oil, Dijon mustard, garlic, red bell pepper, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Set aside 1/4 cup of the marinade to use for basting. Place chicken breasts in the bowl and stir to coat. Marinate at least 20 minutes in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard the remaining marinade in the bowl. Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, about 6 to 8 minutes per side, basting occasionally with the reserved marinade. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
