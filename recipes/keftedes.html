        <p>Greek keftedes are delicious and savory meatballs that form an essential part of Greek cuisine. These flavor-packed morsels are a favorite among both locals and visitors alike, often served as appetizers, party snacks, or even as a main course with various accompaniments. The word "keftedes" originates from the Arabic word "kufta," which means minced meat.</p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices white bread, torn into pieces</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>1 onion, quartered</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons dried mint</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
            <li>½ pound ground lamb</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Moisten the bread pieces with the milk in a large bowl, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mince the garlic in a food processor, then add the onion, mint, salt, and pepper. Process until the onion is finely chopped.</li>
            <li>Add the onion mixture to the bowl with the moist bread, along with the beef, lamb, and eggs. Mix with your hands until thoroughly blended. </li>
            <li>Roll the mixture into balls measuring 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter. </li>
            <li>Place the flour in a shallow pan, and roll the balls in the flour to coat. Shake off any excess flour, and place the meatballs onto a plate or baking sheet, pressing to flatten slightly. This will keep them from rolling away. </li>
            <li>Heat 1 inch of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the meatballs, 8 or 10 at a time, and cook until nicely browned on the outside, and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Drain meatballs on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining meatballs. </li>
        </ol>
